		<h3>"The map orientation is wrong!!!"</h3>
		The maps on this page are oriented the way they're used internally in the game.<br>
		As we are working with a lot of in-game coordinates here, it is the most straightforward to just show the map in the way the game interprets it (where X increases to the right, i.e. "East", and z increases to the top, i.e. "North").<br>
		The compass that's displayed in-game has a correction value for each map (90, 180 or 270ยบ), which is added to the "real" direction when the compass is displayed.<br>
		<br>
		<h3>"The loot positions are off!"</h3>
		The loot (& Exfil) positions are correct (as we are using the actual in-game data), but some of the maps are not 100% accurate.<br>
		That's why a few of the (automatically populated) positions might be a bit off in some locations.<br>
		<br>
		<h3>"There is no loot at the indicated positions!"</h3>
		The markers only show <i>potential</i> loot positions. Whether they are actually filled, or used, in-game is decided randomly. 
		This applies especially to loose loot, which might have 1,000 potential positions defined, but only a dozen are used in a session.<br>
		<br>
		<h3>"What's the point of the coordinates? We don't see them anywhere!"</h3>
		You can, if you use my <a href="http://kronzky.info/eft/trainer.html" target="_blank" style="color:yellow">trainer</a>....
